	<h3>Rail can rev up trade with India</h3>
    <h3>Export by train may start in two-three months</h3>

    <p id="paraone" class="commonpara">
       Bangladesh is going to start exporting goods to India by train for the first time in what is billed by many as a major boost to cross-border trade.
       Once the freight trains start rolling with the closed containers, Bangladeshi businesses will also be able to export goods to different other countries through certain Indian ports, officials said.
       Earlier this year, India lifted the restrictions on importing goods from Bangladesh via trains, and Bangladesh Railway (BR) fixed the shipping costs, they added.
       India also urged Bangladeshi businesses to use its ports for transshipment to other countries.
       "Most of the conditions on both sides have been met. We expect the formalities to be done and export to start in two-three months,"mark said Sardar Shahadat Ali, additional director general (operations) at the BR.
